# 🧱 Programación Orientada a Objetos (POO) en JavaScript - Curso de Fazt

This folder contains practice files and examples focused on learning **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in JavaScript, based on lessons from **Fazt**.

The exercises demonstrate different ways to create and manage objects, constructors, and classes in modern JS.

- `01-index.js` – Initial test script to link and verify setup.
- `02-constructor.js` – Creating custom constructors and instances.
